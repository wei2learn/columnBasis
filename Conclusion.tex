In this paper we have given a fast, deterministic algorithm for the
computation of a column basis for $\mathbf{F}$ having complexity
$O^{\sim}\left(n^{\omega}s\right)$ field operations in $\mathbb{K}$
with $s$ an upper bound for the average average column degree of
$\mathbf{F}$. Our methods rely on a special factorization of $\mathbf{F}$
into a left kernel and a right column basis. These in turn are computed
via fast kernel and fast order basis algorithm of \cite{za2012,ZL2012}.
When these computations involve the multiplication of polynomial matrices
with unbalanced degrees then they use the fast algorithms for unbalanced
multiplication given in \cite{za2012}.

%For some applications of column basis computation, including efficient
%deterministic computations of matrix determinant, Hermite form, and
%computations of column reduced form and Popov form for matrices of
%any rank and any dimension, we refer the readers to the thesis \cite{zhou:phd2012}.

In a later publication we will show how to use our  column basis algorithm for efficient
deterministic computations of matrix determinant, Hermite form, and
computations of column reduced form and Popov form for matrices of
any rank and any dimension
