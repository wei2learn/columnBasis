In this paper we have given a fast, deterministic algorithm for the
computation of a column basis for $\mathbf{F}$ having complexity
$O^{\sim}\left(n^{\omega}s\right)$ field operations in $\mathbb{K}$
with $s$ an upper bound for the average average column degree of
$\mathbf{F}$. Our methods rely on a special factorization of $\mathbf{F}$
into a left kernel and a right column basis. These in turn are computed
via fast kernel and fast order basis algorithm of \cite{za2012,ZL2012}.
When these computations involve the multiplication of polynomial matrices
with unbalanced degrees then they use the fast algorithms for unbalanced
multiplication given in \cite{za2012}.

For a number of applications of column basis computation, including
efficient deterministic computations of column reduced form, Popov
normal form, Hermite normal form, and determinant, we refer the readers
to the thesis \cite{zhou:phd2012}.

%In a later publication we show how our methods can be extended for fast methods for finding
